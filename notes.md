Support for Highly-Available applications

2. The complexity of the algorithm is O(hÂ²), beacause there are 2 loops for.
3. 

Balance the load

1. The complexity of the algorithm is O(h), we have only one loop for a list.
2.  For the measurement of balancing whe chose the number of hosts which work and we can see with balancing load that all of hosts are used to balance the load.

Get rid of SLA violations

1. The complexity of the algorithm is O(h).

Energy-efficient schedulers

static version

The complexity of the algorithm is O(h)
